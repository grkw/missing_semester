Job control

1. `pgrep -af sleep` `pkill -af sleep`
2. `wait $(sleep 5) && ls`
   See `pidwait.sh`. Testing shows the process completion and the `ls` output immediately after!

```
[1]  + 39798 done       sleep 10
animal.py      uninstall.sh
hello.txt      wiki_data.html
pidwait.sh
```

Tmux

1. Did the tmux tutorials! I like it.

Aliases

1. I don't want this alias.
2. Added a `git log` alias `gl`.

Dotfiles

1. Done!
2. Happy with OhMyZSH.
3. Will use one of these once I need to: https://dotfiles.github.io/utilities/
4. VM stuff will be done later.
5. I think all the important configs are included.
6. https://github.com/grkw/dotfiles

Remote machines

Don't want to deal with VM's for now.
