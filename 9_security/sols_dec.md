Entropy

1. log2(# of possibilities) = log2(100,000^4) â‰ˆ 66.4 bits
2. log2(# of possibilities) = log2((27\*2+10)^8) = 48 bits
3. `correcthorsebatterystaple` is the stronger password!
4. "In a year, the attacker can try guessing 365\*24\*3600\*10000=315360000000 passwords. For the first password, it takes approximately (2\*\*83)/315360000000=3\*10^13 years. For the second password, it takes approximately (2\*\*48)/315360000000=893 years." from [here](https://github.com/Ivan-Kim/MIT-missing-semester/tree/master/Lecture9).

5. `sha256sum`: calculate SHA256 cryptographic checksums.
