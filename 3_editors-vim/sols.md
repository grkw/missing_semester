1. Completed vimtutor!
2. Downloaded basic vimrc!
3. Installed and configured ctrlp.vim!
4. Re-did demo!
5. Might not use Vim for _all_ my text editing for the next month, but will do it for code editors.
6. Enabled for VSCode and Zed (really liking that I don't have to see the blinking cursor when I'm just trying to view or edit, as opposed to write, code).
7. Got nerdtree and vim-easymotion. Probably won't use right now but want to in the future. Remapped Caps Lock to Esc. Might use neovim in the future too.
